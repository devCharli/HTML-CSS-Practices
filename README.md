## Lessons Learned

I was able to practice core HTML5 & CSS3 concepts by building these projects. There are still confusing parts, so I think I should make notes on those. Also, I should develop my own design patterns for efficiency.

- Semantic elements
- CSS box Model, box-sizing 
- rem, em 
- Flexbox, grid 
- Media query
- Mobile first design 
- Animation
- Pseudo element
- Position
